# node-lts-iron

Build a debian-based docker image to use as a development environment.

## Overview

The node-lts-devcontainer image installs the following packages:

- direnv
- jq
- less
- sudo
- vim
- sed
- tree
- mariadb-client
- postgresql-client
- openssh-client

The `devcontainer` runs an instance of the `dev` image as the `app` service and intended to be used with an IDE that
natively supports the devcontainer standard. For example, VSCode will detect the devcontainer configuration, run the
included `docker-compose` file and mount your project directory folder into the `/home/app/source` directory.

Futhermore, the `docker-compose` file is setup to run the following services:

- mariadb 10 (with ssl support)
- postgresql 11 (with ssl support)
- redis 6

You will need to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to set the `scale` parameter to `1` for whichever services you need
to enable.

## Build dev image

The `dev` image can be used to develop a node project including React projects. The intention is to mount a local source
directory into the container and install all dependencies within the container to provide isolation from the host. This
works best using VSCode.

The `dev` image can also be used to kickstart a React project. See instructions further down.

To build the image:

```bash
prompt> cd node-lts-iron/.devcontainer
prompt> docker build -t node-lts-dev:v20.18.3 --target dev-builder .
```

To launch the image:

```bash
prompt> cd <PROJECT ROOT>
prompt> docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/app/source node-lts-dev:v20.18.3 /bin/bash
```

## Using dev image

The `dev` image is meant to be used in conjunction with devcontainer support from within a project. Typically,
you would copy the directory into the root of your project, then edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to enable the
following services:

- mariadb 10 (with ssl support)
- postgresql 11 (with ssl support)
- redis 6

### Docker user

The user inside of the container is `app` and inherits the home directory of `/home/app`.

### Support for data

When using VSCode, the project directory will be mounted inside of the container at `/home/app/source`. All node modules
will be installed inside of the container under the `/home/app/.cache` folder.

### Support for SSH

When using VSCode, your `.ssh` directory will be mounted inside of the container for convenience when using `git` from
inside the container.


### Example: Vite + React

#### Initial configuration

- Copy this project into your working directory.
- Copy `./.devcontainer/.env.sample` to `./.devcontainer.env` and edit to suit.
- Optional: Edit `./.devcontainer/.docker-compose.yml` to enable databases by setting `scale: 1`.

#### Open the project in VSCode

From the root of your working directory, start VSCode from the command line:

```bash
prompt> echo $PWD
/home/joeuser/dev/my-app

prompt> code .
```

When VSCode launches, you will be prompted whether or not to open the project in a container. Answer | yes.|  Once the
project opens in the container, open a terminal window (View -> Terminal). Ther terminal prompt should indicate that you
are in the `/home/app/source` directory which also corresponds to your project directory.

You are now ready to create a new React app using vite.

Follow the screenshot below. __Make sure to select `Ignore files and continue` as indicated.__

Once vite completes, your project will have been populated with a scaffold. You will still need to install all node
dependencies:

```bash
prompt> npm install
```

Next, you will need to update the `.gitignore` file as vite will have overwritten the original which is setup to ignore
environment configuration files.

```bash
prompt> cat .devcontainer/common/.gitignore.tpl >> .gitignore
```
